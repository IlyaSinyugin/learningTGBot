# Telegram Bot Learning 

This is a repository that I will be using throughout my learning process in developing bots for Telegram. Different branches will be created for different topics that I will discover, the master branch will remain as a template. 

## Framework
[Aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram)  - an asynchronous framework which I will be using for the development.

## Template
[Latand's template](https://github.com/Latand/aiogram-bot-template) - is the template that I will be using in order to create bots. 

## Note
If you are willing to fork your own copy from this repository, make sure to add a .env file where you include the following code:
```
ADMINS=[your admin id]
BOT_TOKEN=[Your bot token]
ip=localhost
```
